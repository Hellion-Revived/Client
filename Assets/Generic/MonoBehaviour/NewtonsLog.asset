  LogText: 'Today at 12:34 our surveillance satellites Hermes 2 and 3 detected two separate detonations in Burner’s orbit of unknown origin. Both of these originated from zones confirmed empty and our satellites reported no new contacts within the last 24h.

	

	Explosions triggered a Kessler effect and initiated a chain reaction that took out Hermes 2 and 4, while 1 and 3 took heavy damage and were put out of commission.

	

	Currently we have limited information regarding the fate of Civilian Outposts in the area, but preliminary reports suggest Outpost 1, 2 and 4 took heavy damage or were destroyed as they are now located within the Burner’s no flight zone.

	

	We are currently coordinating with AltCorp personnel currently engaged in search and rescue operations at both Burner and Everest.
