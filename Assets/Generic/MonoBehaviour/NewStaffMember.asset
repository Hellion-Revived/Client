  LogText: 'Hey team, 

	

	Just want to remind everyone that a new staff member, Arthur Williams will be joining us tomorrow. Now you all probably know what happened at Burner not two days ago and Arthur used to work at one of those stations.

	

	So try and make him feel at home as much as possible.

	

	P.S. - Randy if I hear one more, complaint about you being a moron. Iâ€™m putting you on permanent cleaning duty.'
