  LogText: 'This is Herman Dimberger to all command personnel. 

	

	EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY

	THIS IS NOT A DRILL

	

	Following the attack by the Sons of Earth terrorist organization, I am hereby ordering a full evacuation of the Knossos Habitat construction site and Bethyr industrial region. Effective immediately. 

	

	All personnel are to proceed to their designated posts and assist with the evacuation efforts.

	

	As some of you already know, we have managed to break apart the incoming object and avoided a head on collision. As a result Knossos construction site is now only minutes away from entering a class 2 debris field and we expect that the Kessler effect will reach class 4 in less than two hours.

	

	You all know what this means, people. Get your asses in gear, the clock is ticking. Remember your training and if push comes to shove use your own judgement.

	

	Dimberger out!'
