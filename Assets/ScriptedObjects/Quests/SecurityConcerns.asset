  LogText: 'Two Tridents went haywire yesterday, fortunately Jim cut the power before anyone got hurt. I swear if I hear “working on it” one more time I’m throwing the entire tech department in the brig. This is the third time this week we’ve had authorization issues.

	

	And one of those damn techs even wandered into my quarters. Claimed it was “an accident”. Damn newbie’s lucky I didn’t shoot him on the spot.

	

	How do they expect me to keep a tight security when half of my team is doing S&R. I’ll have to write another letter to the Old man, maybe he can get me a few extra hands.'
