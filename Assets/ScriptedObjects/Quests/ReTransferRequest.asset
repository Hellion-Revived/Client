	Mr. Hale,

	

	While I appreciate your enthusiasm and know for a fact that Search and Rescue operations would welcome a man of your talents. Due to current personnel shortage I cannot authorise your transfer to S&R.

	

	As you know, our tech and engineering departments are already severely understaffed and cannot afford to lose a man of your skill.

	

	Regards, 

	Nellie Marsh'
