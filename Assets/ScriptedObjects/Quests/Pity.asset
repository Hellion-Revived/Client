  LogText: 'This is a strange existence. It feels like it was a lifetime ago that I walked and laughed like they do. I pity them… They have no idea what’s coming, or how blind they are. There is no truth in their hearts.

	

	The day of reckoning is almost upon us. They will see the light and embrace the truth, or they will find salvation in our lord’s embrace. Either way they will be redeemed.'
