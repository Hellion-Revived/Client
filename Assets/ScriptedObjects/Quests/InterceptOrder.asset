  LogText: 'Attention all ships in sector 2.1.6

	

	ACS Terminus just confirmed a massive object on a collision course with Knossos. Judging by the signature, we are looking at 30, maybe 40 docked modules. Probably boobytrapped, it’s the Sons of Earth we are dealing with.

	

	As you know Knossos is dead in the water atm, so evasive action is out of the question!

	

	There isn’t enough time to redirect that station, so we are going to break it apart and pray that Knossos can survive long enough until we finish evacuating. I know what this means, but there is no other way.

	

	I want all EVA teams prepped and ready in 2 minutes. Bring any explosive charges you have onboard, we’re gonna need them. Now move people, we have less than 35 minutes!

	

	Godspeed!'
