	Hey Arthur,

	

	I heard what happened to you and chief. And man, you got lucky. One hell of a first week right?

	

	Anyways, me and the guys are going to down a few drinks after shift. You know, make a toast for chief’s fast recovery. So come on down if you’re up for it.

	

	P.S. - Don’t blame yourself, you did all you could.'
