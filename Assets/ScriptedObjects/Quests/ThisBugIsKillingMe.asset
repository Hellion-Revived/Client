  LogText: 'This bug is really starting to piss me off. 

	

	This is the third time this week we got a call from security regarding “improper maintenance”.

	

	For whatever reason, every time there is even a slightest power shortage authorization codes reset randomly for systems linked to Command Module 2.

	

	Five days ago it was just the airlock doors at Terminal 2, yesterday it was all the doors in the east residential wing. And today we had two turrets fail in Power Supply Module 6. I’m just glad no one got hurt.

	

	For now I’ve sent a mail to security to shut down all sentires linked to CM2 and switch doors over to CM3 until we can figure out what’s happening.

	

	I just wish Chief Henderson would come out of medbay already.'
