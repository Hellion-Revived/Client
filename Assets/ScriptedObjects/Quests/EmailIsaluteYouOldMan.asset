	I salute you “Old man”. Your men hold you in high regard and they are well trained, if ignorant. I want you to know that I take no pleasure in this and regret resorting to such brutal measures, but it had to be done. The day of reckoning is almost upon us and this calamity is just one of the many trials you must overcome. I pray that Lord will guide you towards the truth.

	

	Heed the omens for we have seen the light!

	

	We are the instruments of His will

	We are the children of a paradise lost

	We are the Sons of Earth!'
