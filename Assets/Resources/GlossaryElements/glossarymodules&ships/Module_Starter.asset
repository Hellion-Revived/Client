  Name: AC - Hibernation module MkII
  Description: 'Not much is known about the Hibernation module aside from its obvious functions. The module’s architecture and systems are consistent with the trademarks of the Altair Corporation but the module doesn’t exist in any of the company’s databases. Its construction implies that it was designed as a life boat for some kind of emergency, but why Altair Corporation would choose to build a new emergency module instead of using one of its proven designs is unknown. Irregularities are also present in the construction of the cryochambers. Several key components of the life support interface, designed to monitor and preserve the occupants neural functions, are not of AltCorp make and bear some resemblance to the designs used by the HADES Foundation.

	

	The module itself serves as a self-sufficient life boat. It has a single solar power array that powers all of its systems, a full life support system, two cryochambers and a small scale cargo and refining system. On its own with a fully stocked cargo hold, the module could sustain two hibernating people almost indefinitely.

	

	Systems:

	- Air Filter

	- Air Generator

	- Solar Panels

	- Cargo Bay

	- Refinery

	- Cryopods x2'
