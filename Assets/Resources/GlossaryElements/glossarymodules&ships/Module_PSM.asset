  Name: Power Supply Module [PSM-AC]
  Description: 'Power Supply module is a dedicated power production unit intended for deep space mining and construction operations. It is often deployed in far out sectors where distance makes use of solar panels impractical.

	

	Altair Corporationâ€™s power supply modules are equipped with industrial grade fusion reactors that produce electrical energy using Helium-3. Due to the abundance of Helium-3 in the Hellion system AltCorp reactors can be deployed at almost any location as they require minimal support infrastructure.

	

	Systems:

	- Fusion reactor

	- Capacitor'
