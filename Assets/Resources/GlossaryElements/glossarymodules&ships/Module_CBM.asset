  Name: Cargo Bay Module [CBM-AC]
  Description: 'Altair Corporationâ€™s Cargo Modules are designed to hold large quantities of raw resources while also acting as dedicated refineries. Each Cargo Module can refine and produce a full range of resources used by other AltCorp modules and ships.

	

	Since loading and unloading cargo between ships and vessels is often done in full zero-g, the central cargo area was designed to operate in complete vacuum. Although it can be pressurized, this is not considered standard practice. For this reason each Cargo Module comes equipped with a built in Airlock system that serves as a connection to the rest of the station.

	

	Systems:

	- Cargo Bay

	- Refinery'
