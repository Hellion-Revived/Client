  Description: 'Regolith refers to the rock layer that covers the surface of asteroids and some moons. Due to constant exposure to intense solar winds blowing from Hellion, these rocky formations are an excellent source of Helium-3.

	

	Rich Regolith deposits are more abundant the closer one moves to the star itself.

	

	Resources:

	- Helium-3'
