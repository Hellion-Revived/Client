  Description: 'Helium-3 (He-3) is a rare Helium isotope used as a fuel source in Expeditionâ€™s Fusion Reactors. Since its fusion reaction produces little or no radiation at all it is prefered over other fusion materials such as Deuterium and Tritium.

	

	Abundance of He-3 was one of the primary deciding factors in choosing Hellion as the destination for the Expedition project.
