  Description: 'Enhances vessel armor

	Compatible with all Nanite Diffuser Systems.

	

	Military grade nanite core designed for search and rescue operations in high risk areas.

	Improved protection at the cost of durability.

	

	Military nanite cores are designed for use in high risk areas. They are filled with fast acting nanites that quickly bond with the hull of the ship to create a short lived but extremely powerful protective layer. 

	

	They are best suited for missions where extreme hazards are expected, such as search and rescue operations inside a debris field.'
