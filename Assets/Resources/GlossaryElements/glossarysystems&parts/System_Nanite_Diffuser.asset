  Description: 'NDS consume nanite cores to generate armor reinforcement for the vessel''s outer hull.

	

	Nanite Diffusers serve as delivery systems for the nanites contained inside nanite cores. They represent a high-tech alternative to disposable ablative shields used in the early days of space exploration.

	

	Advancements in nanotechnology made during the 22nd century allowed for the production of first self-contained portable nanite containers. Along with a new delivery system, these units enabled ships to travel in and out of atmosphere without the extra weight that would be added by conventional heat shields.

	

	All Expedition vessels had to be retrofitted with nanite diffuser systems shortly after arrival to the Hellion system. This was done in response to Hellion''s unusually strong EM emissions first encountered several months after Daedalus'' arrival.

	

	Parts:

	Civilian Nanite Core

	Military Nanite Core'
