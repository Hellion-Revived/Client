  Name: Power Supply System
  Description: 'Power Supply Systems are responsible for production and delivery of electrical energy to ships and stations. Main components of any power supply system include a power management interface, one or more power generators and one or more capacitors.

	

	Power management interface integrates all power consumers, generators and capacitors into a single system and allows complete control over the station’s power output and consumption.

	

	Capacitor

	

	Integral component of any power supply module the capacitor acts as a battery and stores any excess power generated by Solar Panels and Fusion reactor. The system regulates all current properties based on the needs of individual systems and sub-systems throughout the ship or station.

	

	Parts:

	Core Containment

	

	Solar Panels

	

	Solar Panels are commonly used as a backup power system on ships and stations. As they rely on direct sunlight to generate electricity, they represent a weak, but endless source of energy. Most ships are equipped with one or more solar panel arrays for situations where the main fusion reactor is offline or otherwise unavailable. 

	

	Since their efficiency depends on distance from the star and direct exposure they are less useful at outer planets and in lower orbits, where they spend more time in the planet’s shadow.

	

	Parts:

	Catalyst

	

	Fusion Reactor

	

	Fusion reactors generate power by fusing Helium-3. Regardless of individual model differences all reactors of the Expedition use the same core operating principle. Helium-3 is kept in a state of super-hot plasma and contained inside a powerful magnetic field. A combination of magnetic compression, resistive heating and neutral-beam injection is used to ignite the plasma and create a self-sustaining fusion reaction. One part of the fusion energy is directly converted into electricity while the rest is trapped by the shielding system built into the thick reactor wall and converted into electricity using heat-transfer processes.

	

	First commercial hot fusion reactors were developed near the end of the 21st century to satisfy the needs of Earth’s growing orbital infrastructure. Since then the original design, based on ITER and Tokamak facilities, improved considerably. Older designs relied primarily on hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium.

	

	The unusual abundance of Helium-3 in the Hellion system and better fusion properties made it a natural choice for all Expedition reactors.

	Resource Injector
