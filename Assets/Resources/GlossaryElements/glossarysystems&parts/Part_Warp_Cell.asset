  Description: 'Warp Cells are self-contained negative energy storage devices. At the core of each cell is a multi-layered Casimir sphere composed of millions of concentric superconductive layers.

	

	When exposed to strong electrical currents the concentric layers shrink causing negative energy pressure to build between the plates. This effect erodes the structural integrity of the sphere causing it to break down after prolonged usage.

	

	Systems:
