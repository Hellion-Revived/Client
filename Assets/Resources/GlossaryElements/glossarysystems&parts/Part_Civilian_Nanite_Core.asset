  Name: Civilian Nanite Core
  Description: 'Enhances vessel armor.

	Compatible with all Nanite Diffuser Systems.

	

	Multipurpose civilian nanite core designed for prolonged exposure in low risk areas.

	Exceptional durability at the cost of protection.

	

	Civilian nanite cores hold trillions of microscopic nanites that easily bond with external plating of ships and modules. They create a relatively weak but highly efficient armor reinforcement that can easily outlast their top tier military counterparts. Due to low armor value they are ill suited for use in high hazard zones such as debris fields.

	

	Their efficiency comes at a price as the manufacturing requirements for high-end civilian cores are rather high in both energy consumption and materials used.'
