  Name: SoE - Mk9 Jetpack
  Description: 'Although almost identical in appearance to the standard Mk9 model the internal construction of the SoE jetpack bears striking similarities to some of the systems commonly found in military gear.

	

	While these systems improve its performance well beyond any regular equipment they do raise its manufacturing cost considerably as well as a number of questions regarding SDSâ€™ security protocols.'
