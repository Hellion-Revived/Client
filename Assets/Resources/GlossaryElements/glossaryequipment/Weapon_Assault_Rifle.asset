  Description: 'Despite its high manufacturing cost and high ammo consumption V22 ‘Broadsword’ quickly became the favorite of SDS field operatives and even gained popularity among some UNE soldiers, making this assault rifle one of the most sought after weapons by soldiers and mercenaries alike.

	

	Broadsword’ uses a standard railgun firing principle, but features an improved cooling system that allows a higher fire rate compared to other weapons of the same type. High muzzle velocity, excellent accuracy and built in scope make this weapon lethal at any range.'
