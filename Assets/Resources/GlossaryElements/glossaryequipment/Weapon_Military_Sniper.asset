  Name: R15 'Lance' - 12.5/Helix
  Description: '‘Lance’ made its first debut during the “Deimos Incident” in 2104, when SDS forces clashed with UNE military during a mining dispute. Lance’s exceptional accuracy and high penetrating power allowed Skyline field operatives to keep UNE soldiers at a distance preventing them from establishing a firm foothold on the moon’s surface. The incident demonstrated a clear superiority of the newly developed magnetic weaponry over the conventional firearms used by UNE troops, forcing UNE military to rethink its strategy and modernize its arsenal.

	

	Revision 15 of the original ‘Lance’ rifle is a crossover between a railgun and a coilgun where the twin rails are enclosed inside a helical barrel. The projectile, contained inside a helical armature, is accelerated continuously by two brushes sliding along the rails. This allows for a higher muzzle velocity without putting additional strain on the rails.'
