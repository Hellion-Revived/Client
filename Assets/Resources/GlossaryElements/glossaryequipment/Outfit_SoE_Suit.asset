  Name: SoE - Mk9 Pressure Suit
  Description: 'At a glance the SoE suit looks like a makeshift customization of the Altair Corporationâ€™s standard variant. In the field however, it outperforms every commercially available Mk9 model due to superior radiation shielding and ballistic protection. 

	

	This performance comes at a price as the design relies on a number of high end components that are very difficult to obtain and manufacture. How or where the Sons of Earth managed to obtain this equipment remains unclear.'
