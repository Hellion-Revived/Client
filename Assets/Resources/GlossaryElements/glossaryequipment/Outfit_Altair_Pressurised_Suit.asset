  Name: AC Mk9 - Pressure Suit
  Description: 'Standard Altair Corporation multi-purpose pressure suit.

	

	Following a standard design philosophy the suit has no built in power, oxygen or RCS capability, relying entirely on the Mk9 Jetpack.

	

	The suit features a tri-layered construction that incorporates a hard outer layer, a flexible shock-absorbent carbon fiber mesh beneath it and a soft interior. The outer layer offers excellent impact and EM protection, while the shock absorbent mesh dissipates any residual kinetic energy and provides automatic sealing in case of rupture. Finally the suit’s interior handles pressure and heat regulation.

	

	Due to its low weight, Mk9 offers exceptional mobility and this, combined with excellent protection, allows use in many different scenarios. The suit’s main drawback is a low fuel and oxygen supply requiring frequent refueling during prolonged EVA operations.'
