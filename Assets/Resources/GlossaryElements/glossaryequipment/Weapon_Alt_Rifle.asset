  Description: 'Following the UNE’s announcement of the Expedition Project, Altair Corporation began working on a new weapon prototype in close collaboration with Skyline Defense Solutions. The main goal of the project was to create a design that could be manufactured using limited resources during the early stages of the colonization effort. 

	

	The end result was the B-45 Compound railgun carabine, a light and versatile weapon that required minimal resources to produce.

	

	One of the main concerns during the early prototype stage was the lack of penetrating power. This was circumvented by placing additional capacitors along the barrel’s conducting rails, allowing B-45 to trade firing speed for added penetration in “single shot” mode.

	

	Due to its low manufacturing cost, reliability and compact design, B-45 quickly became standard equipment for all AltCorp security personnel.'
