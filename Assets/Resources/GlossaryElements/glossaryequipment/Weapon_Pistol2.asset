  Name: H115 'Glaive' - 8.15
  Description: '''Glaive'' was designed to circumvent UNE restrictions on "expanding ordinance" by exploiting the railgun firing principle. Two rounds are loaded into the chamber before the electrical charge is delivered. Since the rounds come into contact during the firing sequence they are spot welded together and leave the barrel as a single projectile. This creates a high velocity slug that splits on impact causing severe damage.'
